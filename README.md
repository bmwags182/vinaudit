# vinaudit 
First wordpress plugin I have ever built

Custom Wordpress plugin created to be used as an add-on with gravity forms. This plugin allows for integration with VinAudit API, not currently built as a deployable solution for others without edits.

Notes for future releases:
Need to create form setting page which has editable settings for users like origin email, admin email, selecting which forms fields apply to which data.

create a receiving form that essentially catches the data pulled by the first form.

create an enable/disable toggle since the current plugin only works if the form is build exactly like my testing form(not acceptable)
