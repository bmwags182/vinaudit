# vinaudit 
First wordpress plugin I have ever built

This Plugin REQUIRES Gravity Forms in order to function correctly.

Custom Wordpress plugin created to be used as an add-on with gravity forms. This plugin allows for integration with VinAudit API. Therre are a few options which can be taken advantage of with this plugin. 

First you can have a form which takes a VIN and emails the report to the admin(or person of your choosing) for viewing and contacting the user. Great if you are a car buyer and want to see the reports of cars people are offering to you.

Second you can take a VIN and email the user their report from VinAudit without involving yourself. Users can utilize this to get information on vehicles before purchasing.

Third you can get the report data, and send it to a second form with the fields filled out for users to confirm the information is correct before submitting it to your site.
